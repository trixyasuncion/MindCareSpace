        <h2>Carl Jung's Advice on Mental Health</h2>
        <p>
          Carl Gustav Jung (July 26, 1875 – June 6, 1961) was a Swiss psychiatrist and the founder of analytical psychology. Born in Kesswil, Switzerland, he studied medicine at the University of Basel and later the University of Zürich, where he received his M.D. in 1902. After working in a psychiatric hospital, he later became a professor at the University of Zürich. He married Emma Rauschenbach in 1903, and they had five children. Jung died in Küsnacht, Switzerland, in 1961.
        </p>
      <p> 
        Carl Jung's advice emphasizes

introspection and understanding the unconscious to achieve wholeness, as "Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate". He also encourages living authentically by discovering your truth rather than seeking external validation, and facing life's challenges with curiosity and acceptance rather than trying to avoid them. Key themes include learning from mistakes, integrating your inner contradictions, and focusing on the present to do the most necessary thing. 
Embrace Your Inner Self
Look within: To understand life, "Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes". 
Integrate your "shadow": Wholeness is found by integrating "contraries" within yourself, not by cutting off parts of your being. 
Discover your truth: The world will tell you who you are if you don't know yourself, so find your authentic self instead of pleasing others.

        <h2>Schedule worry times</h2>
        <p>
          Scheduling “worry times” allows you to acknowledge your anxieties in a controlled manner, preventing them from taking over your day. 
        </p>
        <P>
          How to schedule worry times:
        </P>
        <P>
          1.Choose two or three times each day. Aim for times when you are feeling relatively calm and least likely to be interrupted.
        </P>
        <P>
          2.Set a timer, and keep each session short (e.g., 10-20 minutes). 
        </P>
        <P>
          3.Throughout the day, write down worries that arise on paper, electronic devices, or a notebook. Do not dwell on them–simply acknowledge them and move on with your day. When worry time arrives, allow yourself to fully explore each concern.
        </P>
        <P>
          4.Use a worry journal to write down your anxious thoughts and concerns. This allows you to externalize your worries and gain perspective on them.
        </P>
        <P>
          5.If possible, problem-solve and brainstorm potential solutions. Break down larger problems into smaller, actionable steps. Ask yourself “what’s the worst that could happen?” Then, brainstorm realistic solutions. Keep in mind that sometimes problems can’t be solved practically. 
        </P>
        <P>
          6.Once worry time is over, put your notes away and consciously let go of those anxieties. Remind yourself that you have already addressed them, and you can revisit them during your next session if necessary.
        </P>
        <P>
          7.After each session, practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation to signal to your brain that worry time is over.
        </P>

        <h2>Mental Health Promotion & Prevention</h2>
        <p>
          Over the years, besides the focus on mental disorders, the focus has shifted to mental health and well-being. In contrast to mental disorders, the concept of mental health and mental well-being is important for everyone in society. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease” (WHO, 2020).[1] Accordingly, it can be said that since the beginning the WHO has integrated the concept of well-being into its definition of health.
        </p>
        <P>
          Three core concepts crucial to enhancing health emerge from the definition of health as per the WHO.[2] Mental health is an intrinsic component of overall health, mental health encompasses more than just the absence of illness, and mental health is intricately intertwined with physical health and behavior.
        </P>
        <P>
          Defining mental health is crucial, but it is not necessarily required for its improvement. Value differences between countries, cultures, classes, and genders may appear to be too significant to allow for agreement on a definition. However, just as age and wealth have many diverse manifestations worldwide while maintaining a basic common-sense universal meaning, mental health can be defined without limiting its interpretation across cultures.
        </P>
        <P>
          The WHO defines mental health as follows:

A state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully and is able to contribute to his or her community. It is a crucial element of health and well-being that supports both our individual and group capacity to decide, form connections, and influence the world we live in.
        </P>
        <P>
          The American Psychological Association describes the concept of mental health as follows:[5]

Mental health is a state of mind characterized by emotional well-being, good behavioural adjustment, relative freedom from anxiety and disabling symptoms, and a capacity to establish constructive relationships and cope with the ordinary demands and stresses of life.
        </P>
        <P>
          While this definition represents significant progress in moving away from the conceptualization of mental health as the absence of mental illness, it raises several concerns and lends itself to potential misunderstandings by identifying positive feelings and positive functioning as key factors for mental health.[6]

Researchers and health organizations acknowledged the difficulty in reaching a consensus on mental health due to cultural variations and sought to construct an inclusive definition while avoiding restrictive assertions. While it was commonly understood that mental health is more than the absence of mental disease, there was no universal agreement on equating mental health with well-being or functioning, resulting in a definition that includes a wide range of emotional states and “imperfect functioning.”
        </P>
        <P>
          The proposed new definition by Galderisi et al.[6] states that “Mental health is a dynamic state of internal equilibrium that enables individuals to use their abilities in harmony with the universal values of society. Basic cognitive and social skills; ability to recognize, express and modulate one's own emotions, as well as empathize with others; flexibility and ability to cope with adverse life events and function in social roles; and harmonious relationship between body and mind represent important components of mental health which contribute, to varying degrees, to the state of internal equilibrium.”

        <h2>Alfred Adler's theory</h2>
        <p>
         Alfred Adler was an Austrian psychiatrist and psychologist (1870–1937) who founded Individual Psychology, a holistic theory of personality. He developed the concept of the inferiority complex as a fundamental aspect of personality development and believed in a universal striving for significance, or superiority, to overcome feelings of inferiority. Adler's work focused on social factors in human development and the individual's goal-directed behavior within a holistic framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alfred Adler's theory, called Individual Psychology, posits that humans are motivated by a desire to overcome feelings of inferiority and strive for significance within society. His approach emphasizes that personality is a unified, holistic whole influenced by social factors, goals, and the meaning individuals ascribe to their experiences. Key concepts include the inferiority complex, the unconscious attempt to compensate for feelings of inadequacy, the drive for superiority, a healthy push for personal growth, and the critical role of social interest and birth order in shaping one's unique "style of life".
